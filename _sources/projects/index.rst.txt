- **Pokemon Emerald Bot**: This was a very fun project! It was essentially checking your screen very few seconds and trying to analyze your location in game! It was compatible with MacOS, Linux and Windows!
- **Camera Equation Solver**: Using React.js and the camera I essentially made an app that was able to solve simple equations using OCR! It was very fun to work on it!
